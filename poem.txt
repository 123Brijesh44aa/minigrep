Golden hues paint the trees with grace,
As leaves descend in a gentle chase.
A crisp breeze whispers through the air,
Carrying the scent of apples fair.

Pumpkin patches, a festive sight,
Carved faces glow in the fading light.
Bonfires crackle, stories unfold,
As the night grows chilly and bold.

The harvest moon, a pearly sphere,
Shines brightly, dispelling fear.
Nature's beauty, a wondrous sight,
As autumn paints the world with light.
